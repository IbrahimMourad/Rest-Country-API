## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Material UI
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I Practiced React Hooks (useReducer,useContext)
- Created Light and Dark Theme using Material UI
- Saved Theme Choice in Cookies

### Continued development

There's so much more about React and its ecosystem, i'd like to know more code structures and decide what's the best way to go based on the project. I'm interested in learning React styled components as well.
